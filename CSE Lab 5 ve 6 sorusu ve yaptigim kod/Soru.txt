Laboratory Task: Dynamic Gallery Management
In this assignment, you will implement a Gallery Management System. The goal is to manage a car inventory using standard Java arrays.

Since standard arrays in Java have a fixed size, this system requires you to manually handle dynamic resizing. You must ensure that the arrays are always perfectly sized to fit the data; there should be no empty slots or null values.

CRITICAL CONCEPT: Parallel Arrays
This system uses two separate arrays (cars and prices) to store information. These are Parallel Arrays.

The car at cars[0] corresponds to the price at prices[0].

RULE: Any operation (add, remove, resize) performed on the cars array MUST also be performed exactly the same way on the prices array to keep the data synchronized.

1. Global System Variables
The system maintains the state using the following static variables. Pay attention to the initialization:

cars: An array of Strings (Car names).

Initialization: Empty array with length 0.

prices: An array of doubles (Car buying prices).

Initialization: Empty array with length 0.

cash: A double representing the gallery's balance.

Initialization: 100000.0

2. Method: buyCar
This method adds a new car to the gallery by resizing BOTH arrays.

Parameters: String carName, double price

Return Type: void

Logic Breakdown (The "Grow" Operation):
Check Budget: Ensure cash is greater than or equal to price. If not, print an error and exit.

Deduct Cash: Subtract price from cash.

Resize & Copy (Apply to BOTH Arrays):

For Cars: Create a new String array (size + 1). Copy old names. Add the new carName at the last index.

For Prices: Create a new double array (size + 1). Copy old prices. Add the new price at the last index.

Update the global references for both.

Visual Example (Array Growth):
We buy a "Mercedes" for 50,000.

Old Arrays (Size 2):

cars: ["BMW", "Audi"]

prices: [40000, 30000]

New Arrays (Size 3):

cars: ["BMW", "Audi", "Mercedes"]

prices: [40000, 30000, 50000]

3. Method: sellCar
This method removes a car from the gallery, calculates profit, and compacts BOTH arrays.

Parameters: String carName

Return Type: void

Logic Breakdown (The "Shrink" Operation):
Search: Find the index of the car. If not found, show an error.

Process Sale: Add (Buying Price at that index * 1.2) to cash.

Resize & Compact (Apply to BOTH Arrays):

For Cars: Create a new String array (size - 1). Copy all names except the one at the sold index.

For Prices: Create a new double array (size - 1). Copy all prices except the one at the sold index.

Visual Example (Array Shrink):
We sell the "Audi" (Index 1).

Old Arrays (Size 3):

cars: ["BMW", "Audi", "Mercedes"]

prices: [40000, 30000, 50000]

New Arrays (Size 2):

cars: ["BMW", "Mercedes"]

prices: [40000, 50000]

(Notice: Both the name "Audi" and its price 30000 are removed. The "Mercedes" and its price shift to fill the gap.)

4. Method: status
Prints the current state of the gallery to the console.

Parameters: None.

Return Type: void.

Logic:

Print the cash balance.

Print the cars.length (Total car count).

Print the contents of the cars array in a single line, separated by commas.

5. Summary of Methods
Method	Parameters	Return	Main Responsibility
buyCar	String, double	void	Decreases cash, Resizes BOTH arrays (+1)
sellCar	String	void	Increases cash, Resizes BOTH arrays (-1)
status	None	void	Prints current info
